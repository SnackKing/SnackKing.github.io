<h2 id="content">Why I chose Ohio State</h2>
<p>When I began visiting colleges during high school, I had no intention of venturing far from Northeast Ohio. However I made an exception for Ohio State for the reputation of their computer science and engineering departments. Surprisingly I was not really a fan of sports at the time, so their renowned football program didn't mean much to me at the time. Prior to my first visit, the only other schools I looked at were small, local institutions. I was captivated by the sprawling campus and the seemingly endless list of opportunities that were offered. As soon as I got my acceptance letter a few months later, I decided that I was going to be a buckeye. </p>

<h2>Awards and Recognitions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Deans List x8</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I have been extremely successful in my academics throughout my time at Ohio State. I made the Dean's List every semester, which requires a GPA of 3.5 or higher. </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Magna Cum Laude</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Students at OSU can graduate with Latin honors depending on GPA. I finished with a 3.87, which earned me the Magna Cum Laude recognition. Sadly
		I was just under the requirement for Summa Cum Laude. Even though I didn't quite reach my goal, I'm still proud of my performance.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>O'Connell Family Award</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Every year, this award is given to a deserving engineering undergraduate majoring in either CIS or CSE. I was chosen to receive this award as a sophomore. I felt truly honored to be given the chance to be recognized in front of many of my family and former instructors at the
		annual CSE award banquet. </p>
