			<h2>My Current Role</h2>
			<p>I am currently working on a client team in Android TV. I am not able to disclose any details on the product, so you are going to have to wait for more details :P. I own several features dedicated to browsing and purchasing television content, and I have contributed towards a variety of other features that are critical to the product's user experience. I frequently coordinate with members of the server team and I've worked closely with the team's tech lead and UX designers to ensure that all of my work meets the standards that Google sets for its products. </p>

			<h2 id="content">Engineering Residency</h2>
			<p>I began my career through Google's Engineering Residency program. This program is designed specifically for recent graduates to help them transfer from school into the tech industry. Participants go through 8 weeks of training to learn the Google way of engineering then serve 2 rotatations on teams throughout Google. At the end of the year-long program, the majority of the members transition to full-time roles at Google. Those who demonstrate consistently high performance may be able to finish after only one rotation.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2 id="content">Interview Process</h2>
			<p>People always ask about what its like to interview at Google so I will share my experience here. </p>
			<p>The interview process for eng res is very similar to the process for a standard full-time Software Engineer. The biggest difference is that there is no onsite for the final round, which makes it somewhat easier. Obviously I won't disclose any problems, but they all revolve around data structures and algorithms. To prepare, I solved almost 300 problems on <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> over the course of a few months. The entire interview gauntlet, from intial contact to offer, took almost 3 months.</p>
			<h4>Interview Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Coding challenge consisting of 2 medium level problems</li>
				<li>Phone interview</li>
				<li>2 consecutive phone interviews</li>
				<li>2 consecutive video interviews</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In terms of difficulty, the problems I was asked were similar to the ones I got from Amazon and Facebook. Many of them fell in the leetcode-medium range, but sometimes there was a follow-up discussion on some problems that would be considered a leetcode-hard. In these cases a working solution wasn't expected, but they did expect you to explain how you would approach and solve the problem. For other problems were working code was expected, it had to pass all edge cases and run as optimally as possible. A brute-force solution won't always make the cut.</p>
