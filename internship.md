<hr />
<p>For CSE, getting a good internship is vital to your future success. As a lowerclassman, I never really had anyone to guide me through the interview process so I struggled a lot during my first two years. At the start of my third year, I knew that I absolutely needed to land a big internship. That internship ended uup being at Progressive, one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in the U.S. </p>

<h2 id="content">Getting the Job</h2>
<p>I initially engaged Progressive at the annual Engineering Expo, the biggest career fair for OSU engineers. I actually saw Progressive the year before, but they turned me away because I wasn't a junior or senior. I talked about my <a href="projects">projects</a> and talked about my academics and managed to leave a good impression. I got a request for a follow-up phone interview the next day, where I was asked more questions about my technical abilities. A few days later, I was invited to an on-site interview along with about 30 other candidates. I interviewed with 2 different managers from various teams at Progressive. We were also treated to dinner and a tour of Progressive's art collection. A few days later, the intern manager called me to offer me the job!</p>

<h2 id="content">What I did</h2>
<p>I interned in Progressive's Native Mobile Apps division. Because I was an intern, I was assigned a special project to work on throughout the summer that I would complete alongside the work I did for my team. My project was to research Kotlin, a new programming language developed by Jetbrains for building Android apps. Traditionally, Android apps were written in Java, a general purpose object-oriented language that has been around for several decades. This new language was intended to bring a modern, specialized language to the Android platform. Progressive was considering switching to this language so they wanted me to investigate it's properties and how it could be incorporated into the existing codebase. At the end of the summer, I delivered a presentation on my findings to key stakeholders of the platform, including the Technical App Owner, Project Sponsor, and Domain Architect. I also compiled over 100 pages of documentation on my findings.</p>

<p>My work was not constrained to MNA. I also got the change to collaborate with several other interns on separate project. The team I was placed on was tasked with building an Alexa skill that was capable of reading business reports and financial results based on various parameters. Throughout the project we were able to experiment with natural language processing and other methods of translating hard data into coherent English. The end product was capable of reading various reports from a DynamoDB instance for various quarters and years. We presented this project at the Intern Project Expo at the end of the summer.  </p>
