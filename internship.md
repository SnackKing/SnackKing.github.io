<p>For CSE, getting a good internship is vital to your future success. As a lowerclassman, I never really had anyone to guide me through the interview process so I struggled a lot during my first two years. At the start of my third year, I knew that I absolutely needed to land a big internship. That internship ended uup being at Progressive, one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in the U.S. </p>

<h2 id="content">Getting the Job</h2>
<p>I initially engaged Progressive at the annual Engineering Expo, the biggest career fair for OSU engineers. I actually saw Progressive the year before, but they turned me away because I wasn't a junior or senior. I talked about my <a href="projects">projects</a> and talked about my academics and managed to leave a good impression. I got a request for a follow-up phone interview the next day, where I was asked more questions about my technical abilities.</p>
